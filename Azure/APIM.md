 API Gateway
 - All requests from client applications first reach the API gateway, which then forwards them to respective backend services.
 - The API gateway acts as a facade to the backend services, allowing API providers to abstract API implementations and evolve backend architecture without impacting API consumers. 
 - The gateway enables consistent configuration of routing, security, throttling, caching, and observability.
