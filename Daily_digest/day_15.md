# Docker real time problems

## Q. Can two docker containers have same name?
No, both are unique.
   - while the container ID and name are both unique identifiers in Docker, the ID is automatically generated by Docker and cannot be changed, 
     while the name is a user-defined identifier that can be assigned to a container at creation time for easier management and organization purposes. </br>

- Remove everything within docker ps -a
```
docker rm --force `docker ps -qa`
docker rmi --force `docker images -aq`
docker volume prune
```
## Q. Consider a scenario, where we have a container running with name webserver. We want to create another container with same name but without stopping/removing previous container. We can change name of existing container. But new one should have name webserver only.

## Q. Difference between docker run, docker start, and docker create.

## Q. List **dangling images** in docker and remove them to free up space.
Dangling images: Docker removes images that are not associated with any containers. These images are typically created when you build a new image on top of an existing one, but then decide not to use the new image.

## Q. **dangling containers**
A dangling container is a container that is no longer running and is not associated with any images. This can happen when a container is stopped or killed, and the image it was based on is removed or no longer exists.
```
docker ps -a --filter "status=exited" --filter "dangling=true"
docker container prune
```

- Suppose you have a container from nginx image. Somebody informs you that there is something wrong with nginx service, how would you process? What would be your strategy?
```
docker ps   # see if container is running or not.
docker logs <container_id> # check logs - any error messages or other issues that might be causing the problem with nginx.
docker container ls -a  # check the container status to see if it is still running:
docker start <container_id>   # If not running attempt to start it.
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash # If the container is running but nginx is not working properly, I would consider checking the nginx configuration to see if there are any errors or issues that might be causing the problem.

check nginx configuration files at /etc/nginx

At the end if nothing works, restarting the container or rebuilding the image
```
## Q. 
- docker stat command
- docker top command
