# Docker real time problems

- Can two docker containers have same name?
No, both are unique.
   - while the container ID and name are both unique identifiers in Docker, the ID is automatically generated by Docker and cannot be changed, 
     while the name is a user-defined identifier that can be assigned to a container at creation time for easier management and organization purposes. </br>

- Remove everything within docker ps -a
```
docker rm --force `docker ps -qa`
docker rmi --force `docker images -aq`
docker volume prune
```

- Difference between docker run, docker start, and docker create.

- List **dangling images** in docker and remove them to free up space.
Dangling images: Docker removes images that are not associated with any containers. These images are typically created when you build a new image on top of an existing one, but then decide not to use the new image.

- **dangling containers**
A dangling container is a container that is no longer running and is not associated with any images. This can happen when a container is stopped or killed, and the image it was based on is removed or no longer exists.
```
docker ps -a --filter "status=exited" --filter "dangling=true"
docker container prune
```
