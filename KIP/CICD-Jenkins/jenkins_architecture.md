# Jenkins Architecture
- Jenkins have a distributed architecture
    - distributed architecture?
        ```
        Distributed architecture refers to a model of computing where multiple independent computers or nodes are connected to each other and work together to perform a task or provide a service. In a distributed architecture, the processing power, memory, and data storage are shared across multiple nodes, which allows for better scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.
        e.g of distributed architecture are: client-server systems, 
        ```
    - Why distributed architecture for Jenkins?
        ```
        Distributed architecture is important for Jenkins for a number of reasons, including:

        Scalability: Distributed architecture allows for the addition of more nodes or agents to the Jenkins environment, which can help to distribute the workload and increase processing power. This is particularly important for large organizations or projects that require a high level of automation and continuous integration.

        Flexibility: A distributed architecture provides flexibility in terms of where builds are executed. Instead of relying on a single machine, Jenkins can execute builds across multiple agents, which allows for greater parallelization of builds and tests.

        Resilience: With a distributed architecture, Jenkins can continue to operate even if one or more nodes or agents fail. This is important for maintaining continuous integration and deployment processes and ensuring that builds are not delayed or interrupted.

        Resource management: Distributed architecture allows for better resource management, as builds and tests can be executed on the most appropriate agent based on factors such as available resources, software dependencies, and location.

        Overall, distributed architecture is essential for large, complex Jenkins environments that require high levels of scalability, flexibility, and resilience. By using a master-slave architecture, Jenkins can provide a reliable and efficient continuous integration and deployment process for organizations of all sizes.
        ```
- Jenkins have master-slave architecture
    ```
    Master-slave architecture is a distributed computing model in which one node or computer (the master) controls and coordinates the actions of one or more other nodes or computers (the slaves) in order to achieve a common goal or perform a task.

    In this architecture, the master node is responsible for distributing workloads and managing the resources of the slave nodes, while the slave nodes perform the actual processing of data or computations. The master node communicates with the slave nodes to monitor their progress, gather results, and provide new tasks.

    One of the main advantages of master-slave architecture is scalability. As the workload increases, additional slave nodes can be added to the network to distribute the processing load and increase the system's processing power. This can be particularly useful for applications that require large-scale processing, such as data processing, web servers, and database management.

    Examples of master-slave architecture include distributed databases, web applications, and big data processing frameworks like Hadoop, where the master node coordinates the processing of data across multiple slave nodes in a distributed environment.

- Explain Jenkins architecture.
    ```
    Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that is widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of software projects. Its architecture is based on a master-slave model, with a Jenkins master server and one or more Jenkins slave nodes.

    The Jenkins ***master server*** is the central hub that manages the build jobs, plugins, and other configurations. It acts as the central point of control for the entire Jenkins environment, and is responsible for scheduling and distributing build jobs, managing user access and permissions, and maintaining the Jenkins environment.

    The Jenkins ***slave nodes*** are the worker machines that actually execute the build jobs assigned to them by the master server. The slave nodes can be physical machines or virtual machines, and can be located on-premise or in the cloud. Slave nodes can be configured to execute builds on specific operating systems or with specific tools, allowing for greater flexibility in the build environment.

    Communication between the master server and the slave nodes is done through a messaging system, which allows for reliable and efficient communication even over unreliable networks.

    Jenkins also supports plugins, which can extend the functionality of the server and provide additional features such as integration with other tools and services. Plugins can be installed and managed through the Jenkins user interface, and can be written in a variety of programming languages.

    Overall, the Jenkins architecture is designed to be flexible, scalable, and reliable, allowing for efficient continuous integration and delivery of software projects. Its master-slave model and support for plugins make it a popular choice for organizations of all sizes that require automation and continuous integration.

- Running Jenkins on a separate host is generally considered to be the best practice, as it provides:
    - Isolation
    - Resource allocation.
    - Scalability
    - Security

- How jenkins master node communicates with slave node
    ```
    In Jenkins, the master node communicates with the slave nodes through a communication protocol known as the Jenkins Remoting Protocol. This protocol allows the master node to communicate with the slave nodes and send build tasks for them to execute.

    When a build job is submitted to Jenkins, the master node determines which slave node should execute the job based on various criteria such as the availability of the node and the requirements of the build job. The master node then sends the build task to the slave node using the Jenkins Remoting Protocol.

    The communication between the master node and the slave node is bidirectional, which means that the slave node can send status updates and log messages back to the master node during the execution of the build job. This allows the master node to monitor the progress of the build job and provide real-time feedback to the user.

    The Jenkins Remoting Protocol is designed to be platform-independent, which means that it can be used to communicate between master and slave nodes running on different operating systems or architectures. This allows for greater flexibility in the Jenkins environment and makes it easier to manage a distributed build environment.
    ```

- How Jenkins master node distributed tasks to slave node
    ```
    In Jenkins, the master node distributes tasks to the slave nodes using a build executor system. Each slave node can have one or more build executors, which are essentially worker threads that are responsible for executing build tasks assigned by the master node.

    When a build job is submitted to Jenkins, the master node determines which slave node should execute the job based on various criteria such as the availability of the node and the requirements of the build job. The master node then sends the build task to the slave node using the Jenkins Remoting Protocol.

    Once the build task is received by the slave node, it is queued up for execution in one of the build executors on that node. If all of the build executors on the node are busy with other tasks, the new build task will be queued up and wait for an available executor to become free.

    The build executors on the slave nodes are responsible for executing the build tasks assigned to them by the master node. As each task is executed, the executor sends status updates and log messages back to the master node, allowing the master node to monitor the progress of the build job and provide real-time feedback to the user.

    Once all of the build tasks have been completed, the slave node sends the final build artifacts back to the master node, where they can be stored or deployed as needed.

    Overall, the build executor system in Jenkins allows for efficient and scalable distribution of build tasks across a distributed environment, making it possible to manage large and complex build processes with ease.
    ```

- What are build executers in Jenkins and how do they work?
    ```
    In Jenkins, build executors are worker threads that are responsible for executing build tasks assigned by the master node. Each build executor can run one build at a time, so if a node has multiple build executors, it can execute multiple builds simultaneously.

    When a build job is submitted to Jenkins, the master node determines which slave node should execute the job based on various criteria such as the availability of the node and the requirements of the build job. The master node then sends the build task to the slave node using the Jenkins Remoting Protocol.

    Once the build task is received by the slave node, it is queued up for execution in one of the build executors on that node. If all of the build executors on the node are busy with other tasks, the new build task will be queued up and wait for an available executor to become free.

    When a build executor is available, it will pick up the next build task from the queue and start executing it. The build executor will perform the necessary steps to build the code, such as checking out the source code from a version control system, compiling the code, running tests, and creating build artifacts.

    As the build task is executed, the build executor sends status updates and log messages back to the master node, allowing the master node to monitor the progress of the build job and provide real-time feedback to the user.

    Once the build task is completed, the build executor sends the final build artifacts back to the master node, where they can be stored or deployed as needed.

    The number of build executors available on a node can be configured in Jenkins, allowing for greater control over the parallelism of the build process. By default, each node has one build executor, but this can be increased or decreased as needed to optimize the build process.

- Where I can see build workspace directory?
    ```
    In Jenkins, the build workspace directory is a directory on the master node's file system where the build is executed. The location of this directory depends on the specific job and workspace configuration.

    You can view the location of the build workspace directory for a specific build job by clicking on the build job in the Jenkins web interface, and then clicking on the "Workspace" link in the left-hand navigation menu. This will take you to the workspace page for that build job, which displays the location of the workspace directory at the top of the page.

    Alternatively, you can access the build workspace directory directly on the master node's file system by navigating to the Jenkins home directory, and then to the workspace directory for the specific job. The default location of the Jenkins home directory is /var/lib/jenkins on Linux systems, but this may vary depending on your Jenkins installation.

    Keep in mind that the build workspace directory is temporary and is deleted after the build is completed, so it is important to archive any necessary artifacts before the build workspace directory is deleted.
    ```

- Once the slave node sends artifact to master node and master node stores it to workspace. How it is further used to deploy that artifact?
    ```
    Once the build artifacts have been stored in the build workspace directory on the master node, they can be further used to deploy the artifact to a production environment or to another server.

    There are several ways to deploy the artifact in Jenkins, depending on the specific deployment requirements and tools being used. One common approach is to use a post-build step in Jenkins to deploy the artifact to a target environment.

    For example, you can use a plugin like the "Deploy to container" plugin to deploy a Java web application to a Tomcat server. This plugin allows you to specify the location of the build artifacts, as well as the target Tomcat server, and automatically deploys the application to the server after the build is completed.

    Another approach is to use a continuous deployment tool like Ansible or Chef to deploy the artifact to a target environment. These tools allow you to define the deployment process in code, and can be integrated with Jenkins using plugins or command-line tools.

    In general, the process of deploying the artifact involves copying the artifact from the build workspace directory to the target environment, and then starting the application or service using the appropriate tools and configuration. This can be done manually or automated using a deployment tool, depending on the complexity of the deployment process and the specific requirements of the project.

- Where I can see jenkins logs in terminal?
    ```
    In Jenkins, the location of the log files may vary depending on the installation and operating system. However, on a Linux system, the Jenkins logs can typically be found in the /var/log/jenkins directory.

    To view the Jenkins logs in the terminal, you can use a text editor or command-line tool like less or tail. For example, to view the Jenkins log file in real-time, you can use the tail command with the -f option:

    sudo tail -f /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
    This command will display the Jenkins log file in the terminal, and continuously update the display as new log entries are added.

    Alternatively, you can use a text editor like nano or vi to view the Jenkins log file. For example, to open the log file using nano, you can use the following command:

    sudo nano /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
    This will open the log file in the nano text editor, where you can view and search the log entries.

    ```

- What are some necessary file localtions to know in terminal for jenkins
    ```
    Here are some important file locations to know when working with Jenkins in the terminal:

    Jenkins home directory: This is the root directory where Jenkins stores all of its data, including job configurations, build artifacts, and plugins. The default location for the Jenkins home directory is /var/lib/jenkins on Linux systems.

    Jenkins log files: Jenkins logs all activity to log files, which can be useful for troubleshooting and monitoring. The location of the log files may vary depending on the installation and operating system, but on a Linux system, they are typically found in the /var/log/jenkins directory.

    Job workspace directories: When a build is run, Jenkins creates a workspace directory for that job on the master or slave node where the build is executed. The location of the workspace directory depends on the specific job and workspace configuration, but it is typically found in the workspace subdirectory of the Jenkins home directory.

    Plugin directories: Jenkins uses plugins to extend its functionality, and stores the plugin files in a separate directory. The location of the plugin directory may vary depending on the installation and operating system, but on a Linux system, it is typically found in the plugins subdirectory of the Jenkins home directory.

    Configuration files: Jenkins stores its configuration settings in XML files, which can be edited directly in a text editor. The location of the configuration files depends on the specific configuration, but they are typically found in the config subdirectory of the Jenkins home directory.

    Knowing these file locations can be useful for troubleshooting, backup and restore, and general administration of a Jenkins installation.
    ```

- Troubleshooting commands for jenkins?
    ```
    Here are some troubleshooting commands that can be useful when working with Jenkins:

    sudo systemctl status jenkins: This command shows the status of the Jenkins service, including whether it is running or stopped, and any errors or warnings.

    sudo journalctl -u jenkins: This command shows the Jenkins log output, including any error messages or stack traces.

    sudo tail -f /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log: This command shows the Jenkins log file in real-time, including any error messages or warnings.

    sudo systemctl restart jenkins: This command restarts the Jenkins service, which can sometimes resolve issues with the service or job execution.

    sudo service jenkins stop and sudo service jenkins start: These commands stop and start the Jenkins service, respectively. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with the service or job execution.

    sudo systemctl enable jenkins: This command enables the Jenkins service to start automatically at boot time, which can prevent issues with the service not starting after a system reboot.

    sudo chmod -R 777 /var/lib/jenkins: This command changes the file permissions for the Jenkins home directory to allow read, write, and execute access for all users. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with file permissions, but should be used with caution as it can potentially compromise the security of the system.

    These commands can help diagnose and resolve common issues with Jenkins, but should be used with caution and only by authorized administrators. It is always recommended to backup important data and configuration files before making any changes or modifications to a Jenkins installation.
