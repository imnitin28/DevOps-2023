- `K8s cluster` = Master node + worker node
- `Master node` = where control plane components run. 
    - The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.
    - In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.
- `Worker node` = set of nodes where application container runs.
    - The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload.
