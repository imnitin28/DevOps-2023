### What is Rate limiting?
- Rate limiting is something that restricts several event (onto which rate limiting is applied) to occur more than the defined constraint in the rate limiting logic.

- At enterprise level, rate limiting is commonly used to keep resource usage within control and maintain service health.

### Why use rate limiter?
- Used as a defensive measure for the shared services to stop themselves from excessive use, it could be intended/unintended in order to maintain service availability.
- Even though your system is highly available, you should have limits on consumption at some level.
